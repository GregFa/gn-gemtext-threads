# Mechanical Rob

We need to run Mechanical Rob tests as part of our continuous integration tests.

The Mechanical Rob CI tests are functioning again now. To see how to run Mechanical Rob, see the CI job definition in the genenetwork-machines repo.

=> genenetwork-machines/src/branch/main/genenetwork-development.scm

The invocation procedure is bound to change as the many environment variables in genenetwork2 are cleared up.
