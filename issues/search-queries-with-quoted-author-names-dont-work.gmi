# Search queries with quoted author names don't work

* assigned: arun

Search queries with quoted author names don't work as expected. For example, the query
=> https://cd.genenetwork.org/gsearch?type=phenotype&terms=author%3A%22Hager+R%22
produces no results, while
=> https://cd.genenetwork.org/gsearch?type=phenotype&terms=author%3Ahager
produces results.

This could be because the author: prefix is treated as a boolean prefix.
