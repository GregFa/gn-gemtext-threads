# Resurrect Mechanical Rob

We need to run Mechanical Rob tests as part of our continuous integration tests. Mechanical Rob has not been run in a while, and I'm not sure the Mechanical Rob code in the genenetwork2 repository is complete. Get it running again and document the process.

## Resolution

The Mechanical Rob CI tests are functioning again now. To see how to run Mechanical Rob, see the CI job definition in the genenetwork-machines repo.
=> https://git.genenetwork.org/arunisaac/genenetwork-machines/src/branch/main/genenetwork-development.scm
The invocation procedure is bound to change as the many environment variables in genenetwork2 are cleared up.
