## Description

WDYT of adding a subcommand called `report` to generate a template for a bug report?

I was thinking of an interface like the following:

```
gnbug report feature-request "New feature: IPFS Downloads"
```

Or expressed as generic command parameters:

```
command subcommand tag(s) title
```

Which creates a file in issues/binderlite directory with a template like the 
following:


```
# New feature: IPFS Downloads

* feature-request
```

Might be bloat but might be nice and convenient also. WDYT?

## Moving to tissue's own issue tracker

Now that tissue is dogfooding, this issue is moved to tissue's own issue tracker.
