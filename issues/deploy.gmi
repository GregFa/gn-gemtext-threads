# Handle Configuration Files

How we handle our configuration is a mess; and this makes deployment a hassle.  In genenetwork2, our configs live in different places, and it takes some fiddling tinged with a bit of domain (gn2) knowledge to work out what setting live where.  With the introduction of blueprints in our code-base, this duplication became a necessary evil because most of the settings QC checks happen in a "utility/tools.py" which unfortunately imports the "app" object.  This import leads to circular imports whenever we use blueprints.  Unfortunately, a huge chunk of the code base uses "utility/tools.py" to get configuration settings; and removing this would make gn2 as is disfunctional.
