## Description

The issue was that the Genenetwork3 code is run under the Least Authority Wrapper (see `guix/least-authority.scm` in the GNU Guix repository), which is essentially a container within the main container. As such, it is necessary to expose any file paths (via the `#:mappings` keyword) to the wrapper, otherwise, it will have no way of accessing the files.

This issue was fixed with

=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork-machines/commit/ff4e69b4b2da29ab35627864b0e5d839fa758a96 this commit.

Following is the older description of the issue and troubleshooting logs:

----

The expectation is that the Genenetwork3 application is run under the "genenetwork" user in the guix container. As is, however, it seems like the application is run under the user with UID 1000 from the host system.

This has been verified to be the case for Frederick's local development system and for `tux02.genenetwork.org`.

To verify, you can look at the genenetwork logs at /export2/guix-containers/genenetwork-development/var/log/cd/genenetwork3.log where you will find something like:

```

2023-06-05 03:46:38     return pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0]
2023-06-05 03:46:38 KeyError: 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1000'
2023-06-05 03:46:38

2023-06-05 03:46:48 unable to open database file
```

Where the user with UID 1000 is:

* wrk (on tux02)
* frederick (on Frederick's dev machine)

This points to some sort of host contamination that needs to be resolved to ensure that the processes within the container are actually run under the expected users and groups.


=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/blob/bfb6fdee924cc60dfdba8ede609a206ca6982454/gn3/app.py#L52-L58 Code logging out the debug information.

### Troubleshooting report

Start the container
```
sudo /usr/local/bin/genenetwork-development-container
```
and get a shell into the container
```
$ sudo guix container exec 10624 /run/current-system/profile/bin/bash --login
[sudo] password for frederick:
root@genenetwork-development /# . /etc/profile
root@genenetwork-development /#
```

get the process ID from the logs
```
root@genenetwork-development /# tail -n 100 /var/log/cd/genenetwork3.log | grep 'Booting worker with pid:'
2023-06-05 03:35:52 [2023-06-05 03:35:52 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22
2023-06-05 03:45:39 [2023-06-05 03:45:39 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22
2023-06-05 03:57:59 [2023-06-05 03:57:59 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22
2023-06-06 06:19:22 [2023-06-06 06:19:22 +0000] [22] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 22
```

then dump the forest tree and extract the sections relating to genenetwork3
```
root@genenetwork-development /# ps -ef --forest | grep 9093
root         500     254  0 06:35 ?        00:00:00  \_ grep --color=auto 9093

```

From these, it shows that GN3 is indeed run under the "genenetwork" user.

From the logs, however
```
root@genenetwork-development /# tail -n 25 /var/log/cd/genenetwork3.log | grep -B1 -A8 'Python Executable'

2023-06-06 06:19:47 KeyError: 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1000'
2023-06-06 06:19:47
```
it shows that the system is running under the effective uid 1000 - which does not exist within the container and leads to the exception shown.

The SQLite file was created under the "genenetwork3" user
=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork-machines/blob/67d3f5dc46422c6b1812547109680c147fdde341/genenetwork-development.scm#L242-L244

which means, when the application runs under the effective uid 1000, it ends up not having access to the file.

I tried changing the code linked above to
```
            (invoke #$sudo
                    #$(program-file "genenetwork3-auth-migrations"
                                    (genenetwork3-auth-migrations-genenetwork config)))
```
but that now creates the file as root and the application (which for some reason has an effective uid of 1000), still fails, since the file is now owned by root (uid 0) and the effective user (uid 1000) cannot read the file.
