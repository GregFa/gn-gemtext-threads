# Full text search

Implement full text search on the dumped RDF using xapian. This may be a feature to be implemented in the dump-genenetwork-database repo using guile-xapian. It is also worth considering that virtuoso supports full text search in SPARQL. But, the query syntax is not as natural language like as xapian, and there may be no stemming.
