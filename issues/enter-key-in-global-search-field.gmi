# Enter key in global search field

* assigned: alex

In the home page, putting in a search query in the global search field and pressing the Enter key takes us to a page with search results. This is correct behaviour.

But, once in the search results page, putting in a search query and pressing the Enter key does nothing. You have to click the "Search All" button to get a response. For example, put in a search query at
=> https://cd.genenetwork.org/gsearch?type=gene&terms=cytochrome+NOT+P450
and try pressing the Enter key.
